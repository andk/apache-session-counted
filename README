Apache::Session::Counted has a radical different view than the rest of
the Apache::Session modules. In short the advantages are:

    keeping track of transactions ("backbutton supported")
    automatic lazy cleanup

The disadvantages are:

    less stable code (pre-alpha)
    less supported code (future of maintainance unclear)

The reason why I developed this module is that I consider this
treatment of sessions as faster, especially in a CGI environment that
can selectively use hidden fields instead of sessions. But I never
came that far to actually try to benchmark it, so I may be completely
off track.
